# DySWAPS
DySWAPS is a small, open-source package which contains the functionality to solve [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) puzzles by calculating the optimal guessing strategy based on a provided dictionary of words and the feedback from the game. This package is mostly written as a personal educative project to help me learn more about semantic Python and to get more familiar with the Python package ecosystem, so I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement (and will continue to improve the package as I learn more).

## Usage
### Dependencies and Installation
DySWAPS has a few dependencies, the biggest of which are `Numpy` and `Selenium`, which can be installed by running the following command in the root directory of the package:
```
pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```
